        <title>Mouse Cursor State</title>

		The mouse cursor is set by assigning cursor IDs to these fields:

		* <pre>context.cursor_high</pre>: (Priority: 1) Overrides all other cursor fields.

		* <pre>widget.cursor_press</pre>: (Priority: 2) Used when the pointer is pressing on a widget. (Travels up the hierarchy until a cursor ID is found.)

		* <pre>widget.cursor_hover</pre>: (Priority: 3) Used when the pointer hovers over a widget. (Travels up the hierarchy until a cursor ID is found.)

		* <pre>context.cursor_low</pre>: (Priority: 4) Used when no other cursor fields are active.

		The populated field with the lowest priority is selected.


		<h2>Cursor IDs</h2>

		The default cursor IDs are pulled from the <a href="https://love2d.org/wiki/CursorType">built-in hardware cursors</a>). ProdUI includes an invisible cursor with the ID `nothing`; this is easier to use within widget code, versus trying to control the application-wide mouse visibility state.
