# ProdUI

ProdUI is a user interface library for the LÖVE Framework.

## Status

**ProdUI is currently unfinished.** It is not recommended for general use at this time. It should run with LÖVE 11.4, 11.5 and 12.0-development if you want to take a look, though.


## Repository Structure

* Base directory: Example programs.
* `lib/prod_ui`: ProdUI.
* `lib/prod_ui/themes/build`: Theme builder scripts.
