## Status

**ProdUI is currently unfinished.** It is not recommended for general use at this time. It should run with LÖVE 11.5, if you want to take a look or make a fork. (LÖVE 12 support is planned, but I have not tested it much with ProdUI since the switch to SDL3.) See `WIP.md` for a rough list of pending work.
