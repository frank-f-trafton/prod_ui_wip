# ProdUI

ProdUI is a user interface library for the LÖVE Framework.

## Status

**ProdUI is currently unfinished.** It is not recommended for general use at this time. It should run with LÖVE 11.5, if you want to take a look or make a fork. (LÖVE 12 support is planned, but I have not tested it much with ProdUI since the switch to SDL3.) See `WIP.md` for a rough list of pending work.


## Repository Structure

* Base directory: Example programs.
* `prod_ui`: ProdUI.
* `prod_ui/themes/build`: Theme builder scripts.
