# ProdUI

ProdUI is a (not yet finished) user interface library for the LÖVE Framework.

The repo is currently not functional; I had been working on it locally (without Git), and I am now in the process of reviewing the code before I copy it over. I plan to have it bootable with LÖVE 11.4, 11.5 and 12.0-dev before the end of November 2023 (though it won't be ready for proper games and such). As of October, it looks like this:
