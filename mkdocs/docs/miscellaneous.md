## Terminology

### Booleans

ProdUI's source code and documentation use the terms *true* and *false* in the sense of "evaluates to true" and "evaluates to false," unless *boolean* is also explicitly stated.

* "Return true to halt propagation" means "Return any value other than nil or falseâ€¦"

* "Return boolean true to halt propagation" refers to the actual boolean type.
