# ProdUI

[ProdUI](https://www.github.com/rabbitboots/prod_ui_wip) is a user interface library for the [LÖVE Framework](https://love2d.org/). It is currently **unfinished**, but the demo program should run on desktop computers with LÖVE 11.5.

This will eventually be a static site generated with [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/).
